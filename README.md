# Nova-based SHA256
 
[Nova](https://github.com/microsoft/Nova) is a recursive SNARK that is suitable for computations with repeated structure, i.e. computations of the form $z_{i+1} = F(z_i)$. At each step, the function $F$ is allowed to have private inputs.

The SHA256 hash of a long input is computed by repeatedly applying the SHA256 compression function. At each step, the compression function consumes the previous 32-byte digest and a 64-byte block of the padded input. In the first step, a fixed initial value ($IV$) is used as the digest.

To use Nova to prove that the output of a message has a particular hash value, we can set $z_0 = IV$ and $F$ = SHA256 compression function. At each step, we provide the 64-byte message block as a private input.

## Running the example
Run the following commands.
```
cargo build --release
cargo run -r --example sha256 6
```
In the above case, The input message to SHA256 will be $2^6$ zero bytes. The output will look like the following.
```

Expected value of final hash = "f5a5fd42d16a20302798ef6ed309979b43003d2320d9f0e8ea9831a92759fb4b"

```

To change the input length to 64 KB ($2^{16}$ bytes), run the following command. The input is again all zero bytes.
```
cargo run -r --example sha256 16
```

## Generating the benchmarks
Run the following commands (shell script tested only on Ubuntu).
```bash
cargo build --release --examples
./genlog_all.sh
```
The `logs` directory will have two files per input length `N`, for `N` in the set {64, 128, ..., 65536}.

- `output_N.txt` has the program output.
- `time_output_N.txt` has the output of the `time` command. This is used to measure peak memory usage.

To generate the logs for a particular length, you can run the `genlog.sh` script. For example, the following command will generate logs for input length 1024 bytes.
```
./genlog.sh 10
```
## Existing benchmarks
The existing files in the `logs` directory were generated on a Dell Inspiron laptop with a [11th Gen Intel i5-11320H CPU](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/217183/intel-core-i511320h-processor-8m-cache-up-to-4-50-ghz-with-ipu.html) and 16 GB of RAM. The CPU has 4 cores with 2 threads per core.
- For all lengths
  - The peak memory usage was about 260 MB.
  - Verification time was less than 150 milliseconds.
  - Proof size was about 10,000 bytes.
  - Public parameter generation time was about 4 seconds
- The proving time for 64KB input was around 2 minutes. Proving times for other lengths are shown below.
